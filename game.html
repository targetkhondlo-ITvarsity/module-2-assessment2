               <h3>GAME</h3>
                <p> Game Retail Limited (doing business as GAME) is a British video game retailer, owned by Frasers Group since June 2019.[3]

                    The company's origins lie in the founding of the Rhino Group by Terry Norris and Bev Ripley in 1992. A number of mergers and acquisitions followed during the 1990s, and in 1999, the company was purchased by Electronics Boutique Limited, which rebranded itself as The Game Group.[4] The company continued to expand during the 2000s, purchasing several retailers including Gameswizards in Australia. In 2007, its parent company purchased its rival store, Gamestation.[5]
                    
                    In March 2012, several suppliers, including publishers Nintendo, Electronic Arts and Capcom refused to supply their latest products due to concerns over Game's creditworthiness.[6][7] Game subsequently entered administration on 26 March 2012,[8] and was purchased by OpCapita the following week.[9] Baker Acquisitions was subsequently renamed Game Retail.[10] The company reported a £10.4 million loss for the 12-month period from July 2016 to July 2017 in its full year results.[11] In the corresponding 2015–2016 period, the company had a net profit of £7.1 million.[2]
                    
                    In June 2019, Game agreed to a takeover of the company by Frasers Group for £52 million.[3] The group have since closed down some standalone Game outlets, reopening these as concessions inside nearby House of Fraser and Sports Direct stores, as well as expanding Game's online business</p>
